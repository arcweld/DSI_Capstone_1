# DSI_Capstone_1
First of three capstone projects created to fulfil requirements for Galvanize Data Science Immersive (DSI).

---
### Intentions and Opportunities for project:
Select and explore a database set which is interesting and informative towards some purposeful end. using some of the skills and techniques taught to this point in the course. Focus on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), but employ additional concepts appropriate for the data and its possible use by an individual or organisation.

## Proposal 1: US Census Bureau
The US Census Bureau makes available a large amount of data, describing its mission as: "to serve as the nationâ€™s leading provider of quality data about its people and economy." (https://www.census.gov/about/what.html)

Starting with data and resources from Census Bureau's ["Explore Census Data"](https://data.census.gov/), I would like to explore ways to understand and describe a community's population and their circumstances. I will approach the information as either an entrepreneur considering the development of a business or as a not-for-profit enterprise considering the offering of a new service.

## Proposal 2: The World Bank
The World Bank is "an international financial institution that provides loans and grants to the governments of low- and middle-income countries for the purpose of pursuing capital projects." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank) It is also a leading provider of information for all forms of global development, especially regarding the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).

Using data from its [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/) site, I would like to explore ways of looking at the world in light of one or several of the SDG, possibly from the perspective of considering potential courses of action for the efforts of a a non-governmental organisation (NGO) to address an SDG in a particular domain.

## Proposal 3: US Energy Information Administration
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) "collects, analyzes, and disseminates independent and impartial energy information to promote sound policymaking, efficient markets, and public understanding of energy and its interaction with the economy and the environment." (https://www.eia.gov/about/)

Accessing data through EIA's [Open Data](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/) offerings, I would like to explore ways of viewing US energy production and consumption. Using the perspective of a state level policy maker, I could look at current circumstances and trends for the mix of energy sources.
